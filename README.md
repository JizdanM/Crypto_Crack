# Crypto_Crack
 A repository made for me to research the cryptosystems and their vulnerabilities

# Vigenere cipher
 A simple code made to crack messages encrypted through Vigenere cipher without knowing the key. The code will be in 2 versions: in python code and in c++. The python version will be the easier one with preprogrammed packages and modules. The c++ version will be the translation of the python code with personally written functions and memory allocation.
